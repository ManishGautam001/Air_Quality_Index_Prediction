# Deployed model : 
https://airqualityindexpredictions.herokuapp.com/

# Description: 
This is a machine learning project on AIR QUALITY INDEX of Bangalore city.

# Data collection:
For this project data is collected from **kaggle.com**  and ran it in my system for analysis.

# Data exploration:
I have uploaded data in my computer and checked for any **missing values** in the data and finally i have droped all missing values because it was very less in quantity so its better to drop these values.

# Feature Engineering:
Then i have checked the **correlation** between features like how features are correlated with each other because it will very helpful for analysing important features.

# Train-test split data:
For training and testing purposes i have divided my data.

# Cross validation:
For checking the accuracy i have used cross validation techniques for high accuracy of model.

# Sklearn (Random Forest Regressor):
With the help of random forest regressor i have designed my model.

# Saving a model with pickle:
Finally i have successfully saved my model to computer.

# The tools used is:
1. Pandas and numpy.
2. Seaborn.
3. Sklearn.
4. Flask.
5. Html and CSS
6. Heroku for deployment.
7. VS Code and Jupiter Notebook as IDE.
